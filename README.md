# Cubesharp
Cubesharp is a Unity project developed with C# following Brackeys - Unity for Beginners course. The project helped me to become familiar with Game Engine Unity and use my knowledge of C# that I have been learning in the last month.

The gameplay is very simple, the red cube moves at high speed in order to dodge the gray obstacles until you reach the end of the level.
